Hi _____, we gon call ya Joe. (Cool) (Wait, what?)

So your family heriloom sausage, cured for 3000 years and slow smoked for another 2000 just to make it sound fancier has been stolen. What do? (Look for the thief) (Tell the guards)

The guards give you the information of the thief who took the sausage: they were the height of a halfling, cloaked in black! They took off to the halfling village in the magical forest! (Search the forest for clues) (Go to the halfling village)

You find yourself in the halfling village, the only place that looks open is the tavern. (kick down the door!) (sneak in the door!)

Good one, everyone turns to look at you. A halfling cloaked in black flees into the back room. (chase the halfling!) (try to sneak around the back to cut them off)

You encounter the halfling. (strike a cool pose and tell them they're busted) (try to knock them down)

The halfling throws the sausage at you. It hits you in the face and you fall over, and the halfling disappears into the darkness of the magic forest (get up) (inspect the sausage)

You get up and look at the sausage, there's a bite out of it. At least you got it back though! (return home) (take a contemplative walk in the forest)

Welp, looks like the end of our tale. Good job?
